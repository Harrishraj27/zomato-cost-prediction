## Overview

This project explores a Zomato dataset to predict restaurant costs for two people and classify the order type using various machine learning models. We compare models to determine the best performing one and deploy it as a FastAPI application.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `zomato.csv`, which contains information about restaurants, including ratings, votes, cost, and more.

## Installation

To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zomato-cost-prediction.git
   cd zomato-cost-prediction
